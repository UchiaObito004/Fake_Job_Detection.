# Fake_Job_Detection.
This project is about finding fake job postings using machine learning.  We used a dataset of real and fake jobs and trained a model to tell the difference. The model looks at things like job title, description, location, and more to decide if a job is real or fake.  The goal is to help people avoid scams and stay safe while job hunting.
